Badminton Posture Analysis Using AI
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing badminton player postures using AI-powered pose estimation techniques combined with machine learning models. The system extracts body keypoints from images/videos using OpenPose and classifies player postures to provide feedback for performance improvement and injury prevention.

Features
Extraction of human body keypoints using OpenPose

Preprocessing and feature extraction from pose data

User-friendly interface for real-time posture analysis (optional Streamlit integration)

Technologies Used
Python

OpenPose (Pose Estimation)

OpenCV (Image processing)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)

Streamlit (Web interface, optional)

Results
Achieved high accuracy in classifying correct and incorrect badminton postures.

Visualization tools included to display keypoints and classification outcomes.

Future Work
Integrate more advanced deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for enhanced accuracy.

Extend system for real-time video streaming and live feedback.

Expand dataset with more diverse player postures and angles.
